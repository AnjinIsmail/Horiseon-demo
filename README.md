# Horiseon-demo 

# Purpose:
This is refactored code project- with a cleaner and simple code. 


The refactor code consisted of : one missing factor on the index.html: 
	-The top navigation section by the title of the website “Search Engine Optimization” once clicked was not redirecting to the appropriate destination. 
	-added div id to line 36 


The CSS refactor code -  The style. css had multiple repetitive settings and was consolidated .
	 The Content section, HEADINGS, IMGS and P had the same attributes and in order to consolidate them on css, 
on index.html, created a div for content and placed the same attributes under .content on the css sheet.
The same was applied to "benefits". Created a div on the index.html and called it on the CSS sheet .benefits
